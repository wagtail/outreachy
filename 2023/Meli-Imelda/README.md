## Introduction

Hello everyone, I'm Meli Imelda (me-li i-mel-da) there's no hyphen between the two names but I like being called Meli Imelda :)

I'm from Cameroon, I am a writer at heart and a Network engineer by profession. I have some experience with web development using Django, React, HTML/CSS and up till recently, Next Js.

Wagtail and I go a way back from 2019 when some very close friends and I started developing [Traleor](https://traleor.com/), a Content Management System and No-code Website Builder entirely powered by none other than ***wagtail***. Building Traleor was and still is amazing and I can proudly say it's thanks to wagtail, so I am honestly thrilled to be contributing to wagtail this year.

I look forward to contributing to projects `Accessibility features documentation` and/or `Adopt generic class based views across the Wagtail admin`.

When I am not working, I love travelling, visiting new cities in my country (hopefully someday out of the country) and eating good food!

I am exited about what lies ahead and I look forward to journeying with you all!

To stand out as an applicant,

- [ ] Help others with their pull requests â€“ spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [ ] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### Interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [ ] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) youâ€™re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.

The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings â€“Â share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing youâ€™ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

- [ ] With your access to the demo site and by reviewing our [user guide](https://guide.wagtail.org/), identify a feature of Wagtail which isnâ€™t documented, and report it back on the [guide project issue tracker](https://github.com/wagtail/guide/issues). Make sure to explain what the feature is, why and how you think it should be documented.
- [ ] Draft the new content to document the feature of Wagtail which youâ€™ve reported isnâ€™t documented. Add it to the issue you created as a new comment, so we can provide feedback.
- [ ] Ask [@thibaudcolas](https://github.com/thibaudcolas) via email or on Slack to give you editor access to [guide.wagtail.org](https://guide.wagtail.org/). Once youâ€™ve received access, we ask you to make the necessary changes in the CMS to add the feature documentation.
