## Introduction

Hello everyone, I'm Meli Imelda (me-li i-mel-da) there's no hyphen between the two names but I like being called Meli Imelda :)

I'm from Cameroon, I am a writer at heart and a Network engineer by profession. I have some experience with web development using Django, React, HTML/CSS and up till recently, Next Js.

Wagtail and I go a way back from 2019 when some very close friends and I started developing [Traleor](https://traleor.com/), a Content Management System and No-code Website Builder entirely powered by none other than ***wagtail***. Building Traleor was and still is amazing and I can proudly say it's thanks to wagtail, so I am honestly thrilled to be contributing to wagtail this year.

I look forward to contributing to projects `Accessibility features documentation` and/or `Adopt generic class based views across the Wagtail admin`.

When I am not working, I love travelling, visiting new cities in my country (hopefully someday out of the country) and eating good food!

I am exited about what lies ahead and I look forward to journeying with you all!
