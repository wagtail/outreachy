# Introduction

Hello everyone,

I'm excited to be a part of this discussion group as I explore the opportunity to participate in Outreachy, with a strong interest in contributing to the Wagtail project. Allow me to introduce myself:

My name is [Olumide Micheal](https://codewithmide.vercel.app/), and I'm currently based in Lagos, Nigeria. I come with a background in Python and Flask, which has allowed me to develop a strong foundation in web development and backend technologies. However, more recently, I've been delving into the world of JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, expanding my skill set to encompass full-stack development and the creation of dynamic, interactive web applications.

My journey in open-source communities has been incredibly rewarding, and I'm thrilled to explore how I can apply my technical expertise and passion for collaborative development to the Wagtail [Accessibility features documentation](https://www.outreachy.org/outreachy-december-2023-internship-round/communities/wagtail/#accessibility-features-documentation) project. If anyone has insights, advice, or simply wants to connect, please feel free to reach out. Let's embark on this journey together!
