# Introduction

Hello everyone,

I'm excited to be a part of this discussion group as I explore the opportunity to participate in Outreachy, with a strong interest in contributing to the Wagtail project. Allow me to introduce myself:

My name is [Olumide Micheal](https://codewithmide.vercel.app/), and I'm currently based in Lagos, Nigeria. I come with a background in Python and Flask, which has allowed me to develop a strong foundation in web development and backend technologies. However, more recently, I've been delving into the world of JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, expanding my skill set to encompass full-stack development and the creation of dynamic, interactive web applications.

My journey in open-source communities has been incredibly rewarding, and I'm thrilled to explore how I can apply my technical expertise and passion for collaborative development to the Wagtail [Accessibility features documentation](https://www.outreachy.org/outreachy-december-2023-internship-round/communities/wagtail/#accessibility-features-documentation) project. If anyone has insights, advice, or simply wants to connect, please feel free to reach out. Let's embark on this journey together!

### Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHubâ€™s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your GitHub profile
  - [x] Your personal website / blog
  - [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guideâ€™s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [x] Help others with their pull requests â€“ spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) youâ€™re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [x] Write a short blog post describing things youâ€™ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings â€“Â share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing youâ€™ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

## Tasks

### Checklist: Accessibility features documentation

ðŸš§ This checklist is for candidates interested in working on the [Accessibility features documentation](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/project-ideas.md#accessibility-features-documentation) project.

The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [x] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your expertise in **technical writing**. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words.
