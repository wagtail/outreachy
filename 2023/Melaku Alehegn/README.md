Hello Everyone, Selam (in Amharic)

My name is Melaku, an Ethiopian Frontend developer. I have been creating web based apps using React, NodeJs and Python. My experience is more of a frontend and optimizing websites for better accessibility and performance. That's why I was interested on accessibility project in wagtail. Being my eyes already stuck on this issue (#10949) I'm also looking forward to make wagtail accessible for everyone.

In addition to my passion for coding, I thoroughly enjoy immersing myself in the fascinating world of history. I find great pleasure in delving into the pages of history books, particularly those that explore Ethiopian history, as well as global historical events and anything else intricately connected to the subject.

I'm looking forward to start my open source journey with Outreachy and wagtail.
