I’m Edgar, a frontend dev, and also a Technical writer. I started my journey not quite long ago, and I heard about Opensource during personal research on how to expand my knowledge and connect with others. That's when I found Outreachy and applied. Now at the contribution stage, I saw the Wagtail project #1 where I could contribute using my Technical documentation skills, and learn from amazing people.

`## Tasks`
- [x] Read the official Outreachy Applicant Guide. All of it.
- [x] Read the official Outreachy Internship Guide.

- [x] Introduce yourself on our Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions discussion thread.
- [x] And/or introduce yourself on the Wagtail Slack in #new-contributors.
- [x] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.
