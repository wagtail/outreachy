Iâ€™m Edgar, a frontend dev, and also a Technical writer. I started my journey not quite long ago, and I heard about Opensource during personal research on how to expand my knowledge and connect with others. That's when I found Outreachy and applied. Now at the contribution stage, I saw the Wagtail project #1 where I could contribute using my Technical documentation skills, and learn from amazing people.
