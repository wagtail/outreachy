# Introduction

Hello everyone, my name is Geoffrey, an Outreachy Applicant.
I'm based in LomÃ©, Togo, West Africa. I'm a French speaker, but I speak English and three local languages.
As a tech enthusiast and Microsoft Student Ambassador, I'm passionate about advocacy, and community outreach, I'm familiar with Git/GitHub and open source.

> Really happy to join you all fellows, and can't wait to bring awareness of Wagtail projects and open source culture at Wagtail.

## Tasks

### Contributor tasks

We use checklists so all candidates demonstrate their interest and skills with the same process. They will help you get started and make sure youâ€™re on the right track.

#### Checklist: Getting started with Outreachy

This is the first checklist for candidates to go through.

- [x] Read the official [Outreachy Applicant Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/). All of it.
- [x] Read the official [Outreachy Internship Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/).
- [x] If you havenâ€™t already, create a GitHub account.
- [x] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/discussions/1) discussion thread.
- [x] And-or introduce yourself [on the Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack) in [#new-contributors](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack#new-contributors).
- [x] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.

### Checklist: open source contributions

> For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to go through all the suggested tasks in a single pull request.

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).

### Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHubâ€™s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your GitHub profile
  - [x] Your personal website / blog
  - [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guideâ€™s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [x] Help others with their pull requests â€“ spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) youâ€™re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things youâ€™ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings â€“Â share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing youâ€™ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Accessibility features documentation

ðŸš§ This checklist is for candidates interested in working on the [Accessibility features documentation](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/project-ideas.md#accessibility-features-documentation) project.

- [x] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of **accessibility**. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your understanding _based on past experiences_. For example, any specific accessibility improvements youâ€™ve done in the past, or specific issues you identified. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [x] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your expertise in **technical writing**. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your expertise _based on past experiences_. For example, any specific documentation writing youâ€™ve done in the past, or other technical writing youâ€™ve made. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [ ] Ask [@thibaudcolas](https://github.com/thibaudcolas) via email or on Slack to give you editor access to a Wagtail website. Once youâ€™ve received access, we ask you to create a new page demonstrating some of Wagtailâ€™s accessibility features.
- [ ] With your access to the demo site and by reviewing our [user guide](https://guide.wagtail.org/), identify a feature of Wagtail which isnâ€™t documented, and report it back on the [guide project issue tracker](https://github.com/wagtail/guide/issues). Make sure to explain what the feature is, why and how you think it should be documented.
- [ ] Draft the new content to document the feature of Wagtail which youâ€™ve reported isnâ€™t documented. Add it to the issue you created as a new comment, so we can provide feedback.
- [ ] Ask [@thibaudcolas](https://github.com/thibaudcolas) via email or on Slack to give you editor access to [guide.wagtail.org](https://guide.wagtail.org/). Once youâ€™ve received access, we ask you to make the necessary changes in the CMS to add the feature documentation.
- [ ] TBC â€“Â Additional tasks specific to the Outreachy application process.

## Research

The purpose of my resource is to understand the realm of open source, I can say I'm doing open source for a long time but never know that it was open source. My reseach goes deeper in the realm of open source, that led me to contribute to [Open Sauced](https://github.com/open-sauced) and help my fellow french native speaker learn about open source at the same time improve accessibility. Interested by documentation and technical writing coupled with my ambition and passion to become developer relations, I decided to learn more on accessibility and contribute to [Wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail).

Here, you can find precious resources that can help anyone to get started contributing to open source and become a champion.
