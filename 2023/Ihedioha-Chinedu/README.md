## Introduction

Hello everyone, I am Chinedu Ihedioha from Nigeria. I recently obtained my bachelor's degree with a strong foundation in computer science & engineering and a keen interest in software development. This academic rigor equipped me with a solid understanding of the core principles that underpin modern computing.

I am also a Backend Developer, working with Java, Kotlin, and Spring frameworks including Springboot, Hibernate, Spring Data JPA, and Spring Security. I have hands-on experience with infrastructure and database tools like AWS Amplify Studio, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Docker, enabling me to build robust and scalable applications.

As this is my first time in Open Source contributions, I have a keen interest in Wagtail and contributing to the Accessibility Feature Documentation, because I am also delving into the field of Frontend development and Technical writing, and I want to explore the opportunities that come with documenting features that are designed to make the application more usable for individuals. I am simply curious to explore the opportunities and learning that come with contributing meaningfully to Wagtail open-source project.

When I am not coding or doing anything that relates to tech, you can always find me on the football pitch. I am a big fan of football and I am a passionate supporter of Liverpool FC. I also have interests in other sports, such as Formula 1, Basketball, Tennis, and Boxing.

Looking forward to explore potential collaborations and to discuss exciting opportunities with you all.
