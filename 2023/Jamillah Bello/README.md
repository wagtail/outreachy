# Introduction

Hi everyone, my name is **Jamillah Bello**. I'm from Nigeria, currently residing in Benin City, Nigeria.
I hold an AWS certification as a solutions architect and am concurrently pursuing studies to become a DevOps engineer. You can often find me immersed in experimenting with creating and destroying infrastructures with Terraform and exploring Jenkins, Docker, Vagrant, and various other tools.

My primary occupation revolves around freelance technical writing, specializing in documentation and tutorials. I take pride in breaking down complex processes into simple, step-by-step guides. Additionally, I create video content, either showcasing the essential features of products or demonstrating how to use them. And since some people have mentioned their birthdays, I'll just chip in that mine falls on October 22nd ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ

My interest in Wagtail stems from my recent curiosity about website development. I am presently in the process of building a website for my technical writing, utilizing Codeigniter. Although it has been an enjoyable experience, I can't help but wonder if there are better options available. I recently saw an interactive website that blew my mind and sparked my curiosity, it allowed users to control a virtual bike and ride it through various sections of the site lol that was amazing. This sparked my fascination with website creation and content management systems, and that's honestly why I chose Wagtail, curiosity ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… ... While my reason for choosing Wagtail might not be as conventional as others', my curiosity usually leads me to amazing places, so I'm just going to follow it to Wagtail...
My involvement in the Accessibility features documentation project with Wagtail is driven by my aspiration to gain a deep understanding of its inner workings. I also aim to create user-friendly, concise documentation that simplifies the Wagtail experience for othersðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ .

Outside of my writing and studies, I dedicate my time to mentoring newcomers at Edo Innovates, in the realm of cloud computing with AWS. Volunteering with "EDO Innovates" is my way of giving back to the community that kick-started my tech journey, especially coming from a background in health.

For leisure, I watch Anime, cartoons and horror movies, and I spend an unhealthy amount of time reading fan fiction(I always find myself cycling between Harry Potter, Once Upon a Time, and TwilightðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… ). And for those that don't know, no... Anime and cartoons aren't the same, please... That's a debate I always get roped into ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Additionally, I'm an avid music lover; you'll frequently find me with my earbuds in, exploring a wide range of musical genres.

Don't hesitate to get in touch should you have any inquiries or need help within my area of expertise. I'm eagerly anticipating the opportunity to learn from everyone and, in return, share any aspects of my knowledge that may be considered valuable.
