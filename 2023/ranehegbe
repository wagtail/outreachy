Hi everyone, I'm Raneh Egbe. I'm a front-end developer based in Lagos, Nigeria. I am optimistic about this being my second time applying for the Outreachy internship.

I mainly work with Vue JS, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with basic knowledge of Python. I hope to get into technical writing and documentation so that I can expand my horizons which is why I will be contributing to the accessibility features documentation project.
In my free time, I like to play the piano, watch romcoms, and read.

I am looking forward to having fun with this, connecting, collaborating, and making valuable contributions.
