Hi everyone, I'm Raneh Egbe. I'm a front-end developer based in Lagos, Nigeria. I am optimistic about this being my second time applying for the Outreachy internship.

I mainly work with Vue JS, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with basic knowledge of Python. I hope to get into technical writing and documentation so that I can expand my horizons which is why I will be contributing to the accessibility features documentation project.
In my free time, I like to play the piano, watch romcoms, and read.

I am looking forward to having fun with this, connecting, collaborating, and making valuable contributions.

## Tasks
### Checklist: Getting started with Outreachy

- [x] Read the [official Outreachy Applicant Guide](link_to_outreachy_applicant_guide). All of it.
- [x] Read the [official Outreachy Internship Guide](link_to_outreachy_internship_guide).
- [x] If you havenâ€™t already, [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/).
- [x] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions discussion thread](link_to_discussion_thread).
- [x] And/or introduce yourself on the Wagtail Slack in [#new-contributors](link_to_slack_channel).
- [x] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like [Dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), or [Medium](https://medium.com/).

### Checklist: Open Source Contributions

For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to go through all the suggested tasks in a single pull request.

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](link_to_contribute_to_open_source).
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](link_to_open_source_etiquette).
- [x] Make your first pull request with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](link_to_participants_readme).

### Checklist: Your Contribution Period with Wagtail

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [x] Make a fork of this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through [GitHubâ€™s Markdown formatting documentation](link_to_markdown_formatting).
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your [GitHub profile](link_to_your_github_profile)
  - [x] Your personal [website/blog](link_to_your_personal_website)
  - [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guideâ€™s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

### Checklist: To Stand Out as an Applicant

- [x] Help others with their pull requests â€“ spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### Checklist: Interest in Learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the outreachy repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) youâ€™re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [x] Write a short blog post describing things youâ€™ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/). You can describe any recent learnings â€“ share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing youâ€™ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform ([Dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), [Medium](https://medium.com/), your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Accessibility Features Documentation

ðŸš§ This checklist is for candidates interested in working on the Accessibility features documentation project.

- [ ] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of accessibility. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words.

- [ ] Ask @thibaudcolas via email or on Slack to give you editor access to a Wagtail website. Once youâ€™ve received access, we ask you to create a new page demonstrating some of Wagtailâ€™s accessibility features.
- [ ] With your access to the demo site and by reviewing our user guide, identify a feature of Wagtail which isnâ€™t documented, and report it back on the guide project issue tracker. Make sure to explain what the feature is, why and how you think it should be documented.
- [ ] Draft the new content to document the feature of Wagtail which youâ€™ve reported isnâ€™t documented. Add it to the issue you created as a new comment, so we can provide feedback.
- [ ] Ask @thibaudcolas via email or on Slack to give you editor access to [guide.wagtail.org](https://guide.wagtail.org). Once youâ€™ve received access, we ask you to make the necessary changes in the CMS to add the feature documentation.
