Hello everyone! My name is Kudakwashe Chris Chipangura and I'm based in Chivhu, Zimbabwe. I'm very excited for the opportunity to participate in Outreachy with Wagtail.

As a coding enthusiast, I'm always working on side projects and learning new skills. I have experience with Angular, Django, Flutter and FastAPI. I enjoy building things from scratch and bringing ideas to life through coding.

Contributing to open source is the next step in my journey. The welcoming and collaborative nature of open source communities is what draws me in. I'm eager to learn from experienced developers, improve my skills, and give back by contributing quality code.

Django is particularly my first choice when working on most full-stack web applications or as a backend solution. Wagtail, in particular, excites me because I see huge potential for it to grow. Its intuitive editor and flexibility for building CMS-driven websites is fantastic.

I look forward to connecting with all of you.

- [x] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.

### Checklist: open source contributions

> For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to go through all the suggested tasks in a single pull request.

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).

### Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHubâ€™s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your GitHub profile
  - [x] Your personal website / blog
  - [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guideâ€™s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [ ] Help others with their pull requests â€“ spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [ ] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) youâ€™re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things youâ€™ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings â€“Â share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing youâ€™ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Adopt generic class based views across the Wagtail admin

ðŸš§ This checklist is for candidates interested in working on the [Adopt generic class based views across the Wagtail admin](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/project-ideas.md#adopt-generic-class-based-views-across-the-wagtail-admin) project.

- [ ] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of **Django**, in less than 500 words. This can be an intro to an existing project of yours, or perhaps explanation of a specific code snippet youâ€™re particularly proud of, or explanation of a specific problem you worked on. The more specific to your own experience the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [ ] Go through Wagtailâ€™s tutorial: [Your first Wagtail site](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html). With the level of Django expertise needed for this project, we expect you to be able to complete it autonomously in less than 2 hours. If you get stuck, ask for help on Slack or GitHub Discussions.
- [ ] Go through Wagtailâ€™s guide: [Your first contribution](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/contributing/first_contribution_guide.html).
- [ ] Find a first issue to work on within Wagtail, based on the guidance in section "5. Finding an issue". In particular, report back whether you can reproduce the problem/scenario described in the issue, and any notes / thoughts about how to solve it.
- [ ] Contribute a solution to the issue you selected based on guidance in section "6. Contributing a solution".
- [ ] TBC â€“Â Additional tasks specific to the Outreachy application process.
