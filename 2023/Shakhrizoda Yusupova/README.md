**Hi everyone!**

I'm Shakhrizoda, you can call me Sherry though :)
I was raised in Dubai, UAE, and later I moved to my homeland, Tashkent, Uzbekistan. You may not have heard of Uzbekistan, so let me give you a brief description: it’s a doubly landlocked country in Central Asia with some pretty cool architecture, and even better food ➡️ And I’m currently based in Istanbul, Türkiye.

I got into tech during my time at university when I took a C++ course (honestly I wasn't a fan) I somehow completed the course, even though I found it challenging. Not so long after that course, I discovered web development and decided to give it a shot to see if it was any easier than C++. I actually enjoyed it, so I went through a full stack bootcamp where I learned JS, HTML, CSS, React, and RoR.

Recently I've been volunteering as a frontend dev on a tech squad at @cherryontech, where we’ve been working on a web app that helps diverse learners see themselves in STEM fields and remind them that they belong. Our idea is sort of similar to Outreachy, which is why I was tempted to apply in the first place!

I’m so glad I made it to the contribution stage, and I’m looking forward to contributing to a project, whether it’s wagtail.org website accessibility or accessibility features documentation (I’m still not sure because I’m new to Django)

## Research
Here are the resources I used to better understand Wagtail and the project that I chose (wagtail.org website accessibility):

- I started with the [Wagtail website](https://wagtail.org/about-wagtail/) to gain an initial understanding of what Wagtail is. It gave me an overview of the platform.
- I also checked out the [Wagtail documentation](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/index.html). They have a setup guide for getting started with the development environment that really helped me. There’s also a part in the docs called [accessibilty considerations](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/advanced_topics/accessibility_considerations.html) that I read through to see what accessibility guidelines wagtail follows.
- I used the [project ideas document](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/project-ideas.md#wagtailorg-website-accessibility) to understand the specific goals and details of the project I'm interested in. Specifically, the scope and objectives of the Wagtail.org website accessibility project.
- [Wagtail’s accessibilty statement](https://wagtail.org/accessibility/) gave me some insights into the accessibility standards and practices within Wagtail.
- This [issue](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/10515) gave me an idea of what Wagtail’s plans are for their audit.

## Tasks

#### Checklist: Getting started with Outreachy

This is the first checklist for candidates to go through.

- [x] Read the official [Outreachy Applicant Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/). All of it.
- [x] Read the official [Outreachy Internship Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/).
- [x] If you haven’t already, create a GitHub account.
- [x] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/discussions/1) discussion thread.

- [x] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.

### Checklist: open source contributions

> For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to go through all the suggested tasks in a single pull request.

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).

### Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHub’s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your GitHub profile
  - [x] Your personal website / blog
  - [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [x] Help others with their pull requests – spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you’re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [x] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Wagtail.org website accessibility

🚧 This checklist is for candidates interested in working on the [Wagtail.org website accessibility](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/project-ideas.md#wagtailorg-website-accessibility) project.
