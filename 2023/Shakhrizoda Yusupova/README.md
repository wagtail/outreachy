**Hi everyone!**

I'm Shakhrizoda, you can call me Sherry though :)
I was raised in Dubai, UAE, and later I moved to my homeland, Tashkent, Uzbekistan. You may not have heard of Uzbekistan, so let me give you a brief description: it‚Äôs a doubly landlocked country in Central Asia with some pretty cool architecture, and even better food ‚û°Ô∏è And I‚Äôm currently based in Istanbul, T√ºrkiye.

I got into tech during my time at university when I took a C++ course (honestly I wasn't a fan) I somehow completed the course, even though I found it challenging. Not so long after that course, I discovered web development and decided to give it a shot to see if it was any easier than C++. I actually enjoyed it, so I went through a full stack bootcamp where I learned JS, HTML, CSS, React, and RoR.

Recently I've been volunteering as a frontend dev on a tech squad at @cherryontech, where we‚Äôve been working on a web app that helps diverse learners see themselves in STEM fields and remind them that they belong. Our idea is sort of similar to Outreachy, which is why I was tempted to apply in the first place!

I‚Äôm so glad I made it to the contribution stage, and I‚Äôm looking forward to contributing to a project, whether it‚Äôs wagtail.org website accessibility or accessibility features documentation (I‚Äôm still not sure because I‚Äôm new to Django)

## Research
Here are the resources I used to better understand Wagtail and the project that I chose (_Wagtail.org website accessibility_):

- I started with the [Wagtail website](https://wagtail.org/about-wagtail/) to gain an initial understanding of what Wagtail is. It gave me an overview of the platform.
- I frequently checked the [project ideas document](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/project-ideas.md#wagtailorg-website-accessibility) to understand the specific goals and details of the project I'm interested in.
- I also checked out the [Wagtail documentation](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/index.html). They have a setup guide for getting started with the development environment that was really useful. There‚Äôs also a part in the docs called [accessibilty considerations](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/advanced_topics/accessibility_considerations.html) that I read through to see what accessibility guidelines wagtail follows.
- Similarly, [Wagtail‚Äôs accessibilty statement](https://wagtail.org/accessibility/) gave me some insights into the accessibility standards and practices within Wagtail.
- This [issue](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/10515) gave me an idea of what Wagtail‚Äôs plans are for their accessibility audit.
- I used the [GitHub thread](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/discussions/3) about the _wagtail.org website accessibility_ project or the `#outreachy` channel in [Wagtail's slack](https://wagtailcms.slack.com/ssb/redirect) to see if questions I had regarding the project were already answered or not.

## Blog Posts

1. My blog post about something I've learned recently: [Learning Adobe Illustrator as a Software Developer](https://medium.com/@shyusupova4/learning-adobe-illustrator-as-a-software-developer-268fbbb6ed1b). It scored grade 6 on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>.

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you‚Äôve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you‚Äôre interested in.

You can describe any recent learnings ‚Äì share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you‚Äôve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn‚Äôt have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
