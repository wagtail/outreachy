# Introduction

Hello, I'm Brian Mugo from Kenya, a dedicated programmer with a strong passion for Inclusive Education and Web Accessibility. I'm eager to participate in Outreachy with Wagtail because I believe in equal opportunities for all, especially within the tech community. Wagtail's project [#3](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/discussions/3) on wagtail.org accessibility particularly interests me, as it offers a chance to apply and expand my Web Accessibility skills to ensure the website is accessible to everyone, regardless of disabilities, ensuring we all win at the end of the day.

My journey into Outreachy and open source contributions began during my time as a volunteer at Ushahidi Inc. There, I gained exposure to Web Accessibility, Code Architecture, Maintenance, and Technical Documentation. This experience taught me that contributing to a community is about giving and sharing knowledge, and celebrating each other's successes, no matter how small.

Beyond my keyboard, I enjoy weightlifting, learning Arabic, and reading and listening to the Quran.listening to podcasts on topics like EdTech and Psychology,

I understand that Outreachy and open source communities thrive on collaboration and shared contributions, and I'm excited to be a part of that journey.

Cheers!

## Research

Due to my intereset in Wagtail's project [#3](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/discussions/3) on wagtail.org accessibility. I was tried to understand more about it by researching on topics such as OSS contribution, Understanding Wagtail CMS and Web Accessibility (a11y).

## Tasks

### Getting started with Outreachy

- [x] Read the official [Outreachy Applicant Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/). All of it.
- [x] Read the official [Outreachy Internship Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/).
- [x] If you haven’t already, create a GitHub account.
- [x] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/discussions/1) discussion thread.

- [x] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.

### Open Source Contributions

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).

### Your contribution period with Wagtail

- [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHub’s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your GitHub profile
  - [x] Your personal website / blog
  - [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [x] Help others with their pull requests – spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### Interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you’re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [x] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Wagtail.org website accessibility

- [x] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of **accessibility**. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your understanding _based on past experiences_. For example, any specific accessibility improvements you’ve done in the past, or specific issues you identified. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [x] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of **Django**, in less than 500 words. This can be an intro to an existing project of yours, or perhaps explanation of a specific code snippet you’re particularly proud of, or explanation of a specific problem you worked on. The more specific to your own experience the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [x] Go through Wagtail’s tutorial: [Your first Wagtail site](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html). If you get stuck, ask for help on Slack or GitHub Discussions.
- [x] Set up [wagtail.org in Gitpod](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail.org), via the "Open in Gitpod" link in the README.
- [x] Find an accessibility issue on the live [wagtail.org](https://wagtail.org/) website, and report it on the project’s issue tracker, with appropriate details (title, description, screenshot if applicable, why you think this is an accessibility issue).
- [X] Fork the [wagtail.org repository](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail.org) and set up your own copy for development, either in Gitpod or on your own computer.
- [x] Contribute a solution to the issue you selected, by reproducing it on your copy of the project, and submitting a pull request to the main project.
- [ ] TBC – Additional tasks specific to the Outreachy application process.
