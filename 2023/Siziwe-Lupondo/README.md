Hello, My name is Siziwe Lupondo, and I proudly call South Africa my home. I'm thrilled to introduce myself as an aspiring contributor for Outreachy with a keen interest in enhancing Wagtail's Accessibility features documentation. üìö

I have experience in using softwares like Python üêç, Sphinx üìñ, Git üå≤, C++ üñ•Ô∏è, HTML üåê, and JavaScript üíª. üõ†Ô∏è These tools have shaped me into a documentation enthusiast, and I'm all about making tech accessible to all üåü.

I'm drawn to Outreachy and open source communities because they embody the spirit of collaboration and inclusivity üåà. I believe in the power of collective effort, where every voice and talent is celebrated. My journey to this point has been guided by my deep appreciation for Outreachy's mission to empower underrepresented groups in tech. üåü

I'm eager to learn and grow alongside the amazing project contributors, and I'm equally excited to share my knowledge and skills. 

Lets make tech accessible for all üôå!
