ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone, I'm Nsingwire Victor, based in Uganda. I'm thrilled to be a part of the Outreachy program with Wagtail!

With a strong passion in Django and Python development, I'm eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to the Wagtail community. My passion for building robust and efficient web applications has led me to explore various avenues within the open-source community, and I'm excited about the opportunity to make a meaningful impact with Wagtail.

I understand the collaborative nature of open source communities and the significance of effective communication and teamwork. I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and learning from the diverse experiences within the Wagtail community.
