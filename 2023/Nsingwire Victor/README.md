## My Wagtail Adventure

I've been learning about Wagtail. Their website, https://www.wagtail.io/, helped me understand the basics, and their code on GitHub, https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail, showed me how it works.

I got interested in their "Adopt generic class based views across the Wagtail admin" project. They want to organize their code better. I know a bit about Django and Python, so I want to help.

I learned that working together and talking to others is really important. The Wagtail community is all about helping each other, and it inspired me.

I can't wait to start helping with the Wagtail project. I'm sure I'll learn a lot and make a difference. I'll be focusing on the project to use generic class-based views in the admin: https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/8365. It's just right for me!
