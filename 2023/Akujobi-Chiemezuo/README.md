## Introduction

👋 Hello everyone!! My name is Chiemezuo, but feel free to call me 'Mezuo'. I'm a Node JS and Django 🐍 developer based in Nigeria. I made it a goal to contribute to open source before my next birthday 🎂 , and Outreachy looked like the best opportunity for that. So much of what I use daily is open source, and I know I have a part to play in contributing 🤝. Wagtail's issue #8365 (Adopt generic class-based views across all areas of admin) caught my attention the quickest out of all the projects listed. And so far, I feel very excited 😄.

When I'm not coding, I like to clatter away my thoughts on a keypad or read a nice book 📖. I also love to exercise 🏋️, and do anything that helps me mentally unwind, and takes me away from a screen 💻.

For Outreachy, this will be my first time participating, but I've read and followed up with all their sessions to get a good enough understanding. I also realize that at the heart of all open-source communities is communication 📞. I really look forward to the upcoming weeks (and possibly years).

## Research

These are a couple of resources I've really found useful with regards this project. They have helped in various ways, some of which include: helping me understand what certain lines of code do, and helping me with some errors. Some of the resources I've come across have been specific to a tiny subset of issues that came from even more specific tasks, so I will skip those and instead, add the general ones that help with almost everything. Here's the list in no specific order of importance.

- **Google's [Bard](https://bard.google.com)**: I used this mostly for resolving issues with my git and github, such as learning how to rebase commits. 

- **OpenAI's [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)**: I used this mostly for pasting snippets of code from the Wagtail repo and asking what that code was responsible for, to get a better sense of understanding.
- **[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)**: For when I ran into errors that just didn't seem to make sense. An example of which was when a template file kept crashing a unit test after I modified the pre-existing python code.
- **Wagtail's [Contribution guide](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/latest/contributing/index.html)**: It's what made it possible for me to even get started on anything. I fall back to it every now and then to drive any decision I make.
- **The [Google](https://google.com) search engine**: It goes without saying, that I have had to google a lot of things.
- **Mozilla [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org)**: I wasn't sure whether to mention this on its own, because most of the time it was Google that directed me there, but I'll put it in nonetheless. Wagtail was built with a fully functional admin dashboard, which does come with a lot of HTML and CSS. Mozilla docs are like the bible of HTML and CSS. Even for stuff you think you know, there's usually something new you see there every time.
- **Wagtail's [github](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail)**: This is a big gold mine of information. It helped that issues raised practically gave guidelines on how to reproduce the errors. I found myself reproducing some errors for the fun of it, and trying out fixes. Some of which I raise PR's for. I got my first and second issue here as well. Also in the github, everyone can see discussions about different things ongoing in the development and read professionals talk. I liked reading the team's conversations (even when some things felt too technical to understand), because it helped get a sense of the much larger picture. And there was the Pull Requests section. I used to check on it daily 😄. I'd read what the proposed change, then go straight to the "Files changed" section to know how people went about their fixes. Wagtail's github page is also where you get feedback that directly helps the project.
- **Wagtail's [slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack)**: If you want to go fast, you could try going alone, but if you really want to go far, you should definitely join the Slack. Sometimes, I see answers to questions I didn't know I had. On one occasion, helping someone with pull requests helped me strengthen my understanding of concepts. Some other times, when I want to help with a question asked in a public channel, I read the comments thus far and see an even better solution than I would have offered, which makes me learn something new.
- **This [guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) on how to contribute**: I mean, it goes without saying 😄.
- **StackOverflow's [guide](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) to asking good questions**: The article might seem specific to Stack Overflow, but it really gives a good template for asking questions that people would readily answer if they can. It also takes away frustration for anyone who would love to help, because it helps avoid a needless back and forth of asking more questions just to understand the initial question. 


## Blog posts

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you’re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.

The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
