Hello everyone, My name is Terkuma, pronounced 'Taykuma'. I am from Nigeria and I am a web developer , front end to be specific. I usually work with HTML,CSS ,Tailwind and ReactJS . My adventure doesn't stop there, I am currently learning python programming language.

In my personal time, I prefer to listen to podcasts or good music . Occasionally , I get in involved in physical activities like running or playing badminton.

As a newcomer to the Outreachy program, I'm brimming with excitement and curiosity. For me, it's more than just an opportunity; it's a gateway to acquiring new skills, forging connections with fellow contributors and mentors, and contributing meaningfully to the open source community. I can't wait to get to know you all better. :)
