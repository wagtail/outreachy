# Introduction

Hello Everyone, My name is Igbo ujunwa mary but you can call me Uju. I am a Backend Developer with Python Django and a Technical Writer based in Lagos, Nigeria. It has been an Amazing experience after I transitioned into Tech as my first degree was Criminology and Security studies. I have always been Passionate about Coding and here I am still following my dreams.
I am very much interested in contributing to wagtail project "Adopt generic class-based views across all areas of admin". During my Learning period, Generic class-based views was part of my Favorite to work with so when I saw the title, I knew I have found the right project that I would enjoy contributing on. Most importantly, Wagtail is a project of interest that will help build my skills and widen my horizon, I carefully went through it's page and with strong conviction I can say that the aim of the Project is in alignment with what I need. It would be a great pleasure to learn while working on this project.
This is my first Participation for Outreachy and I'm Super excited. Attending the Opensource Festival 2023, inspired me and made me eager to be a contributor, I was able to learn a whole lot about the community and have been learning about Open source till date.
Outside of my Techsis life, I prefer to call myself an introverted extrovert. I love fun activities, I enjoy playing games that require me to brainstorm such as puzzles and that is why "4 pics 1 word" game is still my favorite game, I love Adventures and exploring new places and learning new things. Music has a way of triggering me plus I am always full of energy and fun fact, my Energy is at it's Peak this month cause it's my Birthday month and being part of Outreachy to contribute is part of the best things to happen on my birth month.
I look forward to creating long lasting connections on here, learning from my mentors while being a value added teammate to my fellow contributors

The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Adopt Generic Class Based Views Across the wagtail Admin checklist

- [x] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of Django, in less than 500 words. This can be an intro to an existing project of yours, or perhaps explanation of a specific code snippet you’re particularly proud of, or explanation of a specific problem you worked on. The more specific to your own experience the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

- [x] Go through Wagtail’s tutorial: Your first Wagtail site. With the level of Django expertise needed for this project, we expect you to be able to complete it autonomously in less than 2 hours. If you get stuck, ask for help on Slack or GitHub Discussions.

- [x] Go through Wagtail’s guide: Your first contribution.

- [x] Find a first issue to work on within Wagtail, based on the guidance in section "5. Finding an issue". In particular, report back whether you can reproduce the problem/scenario described in the issue, and any notes / thoughts about how to solve it.

- [ ] Contribute a solution to the issue you selected based on guidance in section "6. Contributing a solution".

- [ ] TBC – Additional tasks specific to the Outreachy application process.

Contributing As A First Timer To Open Source.

As a new contributor to an Open source project, it's normal to feel overwhelmed and not so sure of where to start from. Learning is a great way to start and that's what I did. I began to learn about Wagtail and found out the useful tools I needed which the understanding of Git and GitHub was of importance. I focused more on it as I had little knowledge of it and used it more for pushing codes to my account. I learned with Git I could manage changes to files over time and go back to see those changes. With this, I knew as an open-source project, if I didn't learn how to use Git and GitHub I wouldn't be able to contribute to a project. I learned the correct way to contribute to a Project and the codes for it. The following steps are a summary of what I learned on contributing to a Project as a first-timer:

- First, I will open the link to the project and fork the repository so that I can have my copy.

- I will go to my copy, and click on Code to copy the link to my repository.

- I will use the command prompt in cloning my copy to my local machine as I already have Git and the version needed.

- I will add the link of the original repository to my local repository after I have Cd into my project.

- Then I update my local repository to make sure it is up-to-date with the master branch.

- I would create a new local branch where I would make changes.

- I will open my VS Code and before I make changes, I will make sure on my command prompt that I am on the new branch I created.

- I will use the git commands to Add the files, commit those changes and then push the changes to my GitHub account.

- On my GitHub account, I will see the new branch then click on the compare and create a pull request

- I will make sure to give a detailed description of what I did in the pull request and then wait for merging.

I also learned through some mistakes I made when I started, which were to not make direct commit to the default branch as it leads to conflict and to always make sure my branch is up to date before pushing changes.

### Blog on Django

[Blog on Django link](<https://ujuthetechsis.hashnode.dev/generic-class-based-views>)

Before I talk about Generic class-based views, it's important to note that it is used when building using the Django rest framework. Django rest framework takes care of the heavy lifting of transforming our database models into RESTful API. There are three main steps in the process which are Urls.py, Serializers.py and Views.py. It is in Views.py that we use the Generic class-based views. The Views.py is a file that we use in applying logic to each Endpoint. During my training process as a Backend developer with Python Django, I had different areas which I enjoyed working with and the Generic class-based view was part of it. Under Views.py there are different types of views. They are:

- Function based views

- Class based views

- Generic based views

I have worked with the three types of views in projects we did at univelcity. The Generic class based views was preferrable to me as I didn't have to write much code on my own. When it comes to creating blogs, the Generic class based views are helpful as it will list all available blog posts as a read-write Endpoint. To use the Generic class basedviews in our views.py we import the following:

From rest_framework import generics

From .models import Post

From .serializers import PostSerializer

class PostList(ListCreateAPIView):

    queryset = Post.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PostSerializer

class Articledetail(RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):

    queryset = Post.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PostSerializer

We have the following under the Generic class based views:

- ListCeateAPIView: This is for the get and post request.
- RetrieveAPIView: This is for the get request.
- RetrieveDestroyAPIView: This is for get or delete request.
- RetrieveUpdateAPIView: This is for the get or update request.
- RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView: This is for get, update or delete.

The cover picture is from one of the project we worked on where we used the three views and concluded on which one to use for the particular project.
