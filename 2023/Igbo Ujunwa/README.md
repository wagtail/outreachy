## Introduction

Hello Everyone, My name is Igbo ujunwa mary but you can call me Uju. I am a Backend Developer with Python Django and a Technical Writer based in Lagos, Nigeria. It has been an Amazing experience after I transitioned into Tech as my first degree was Criminology and Security studies. I have always been Passionate about Coding and here I am still following my dreams.
I am very much interested in contributing to wagtail project "Adopt generic class-based views across all areas of admin". During my Learning period, Generic class-based views was part of my Favorite to work with so when I saw the title, I knew I have found the right project that I would enjoy contributing on. Most importantly, Wagtail is a project of interest that will help build my skills and widen my horizon, I carefully went through it's page and with strong conviction I can say that the aim of the Project is in alignment with what I need. It would be a great pleasure to learn while working on this project.
This is my first Participation for Outreachy and I'm Super excited. Attending the Opensource Festival 2023, inspired me and made me eager to be a contributor, I was able to learn a whole lot about the community and have been learning about Open source till date.
Outside of my Techsis life, I prefer to call myself an introverted extrovert. I love fun activities, I enjoy playing games that require me to brainstorm such as puzzles and that is why "4 pics 1 word" game is still my favorite game, I love Adventures and exploring new places and learning new things. Music has a way of triggering me plus I am always full of energy and fun fact, my Energy is at it's Peak this month cause it's my Birthday month and being part of Outreachy to contribute is part of the best things to happen on my birth month.
I look forward to creating long lasting connections on here, learning from my mentors while being a value added teammate to my fellow contributors

## Tasks

- [ ] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of Django, in less than 500 words. This can be an intro to an existing project of yours, or perhaps explanation of a specific code snippet you’re particularly proud of, or explanation of a specific problem you worked on. The more specific to your own experience the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

- [ ] Go through Wagtail’s tutorial: Your first Wagtail site. With the level of Django expertise needed for this project, we expect you to be able to complete it autonomously in less than 2 hours. If you get stuck, ask for help on Slack or GitHub Discussions.


- [ ] Go through Wagtail’s guide: Your first contribution.

- [ ] Find a first issue to work on within Wagtail, based on the guidance in section "5. Finding an issue". In particular, report back whether you can reproduce the problem/scenario described in the issue, and any notes / thoughts about how to solve it.
