### Introduction

Hello everyone! 😁 My name is Varun and I am based in India. I am learning to be a developer and wanted to get a good grasp of development culture via internship. Outreachy was my best option. Though I am not a full-fledged developer, I am on my learning pathway, hoping to receive help and love from you all. I decided to do minor and awesome tasks such as reading, reviewing and writing documentations of open source software. Wagtail's "Accessibility features documentation ❤️" opening caught my attention. Hoping to do my best and get selected. Just excited to contribute with so much excitement. 😃
