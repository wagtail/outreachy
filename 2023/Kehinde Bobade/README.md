## Introduction

Hi Everyone. My name is Kehinde Bobade. I'm a backend developer and I am based in South-West Nigeria. This is my first time applying to Outreachy, and I'm so excited to be here.

I have a background in Computer Science as I have a CS degree and I have some experience working as a Backend Engineer. In my day-to-day activities, I work mainly with Django, but also with other Python frameworks like Tornado and FastAPI. I see Outreachy as a fantastic opportunity to learn, collaborate, and contribute to open source projects. It's a bit of a leap for me, but I'm ready for the challenge and the chance to grow.

During my spare time, I enjoy playing chess, listening to podcasts, and reading fiction. These hobbies provide a nice break from my screens and keep me grounded. I'm looking forward to this Outreachy journey, hoping to learn and connect along the way.
