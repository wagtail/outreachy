## Introduction

Hello everyone, Iâ€™m Aleru Divine Chinwendu and Iâ€™m from Nigeria. I am a software developer, technical writer, and love to read. I am mostly passionate about new technology and simplifying life and I love staying up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in the tech industry.

I've always been intrigued by the power of effective content management systems, and Wagtail, with its polished administration interface built upon the Django web framework, stands out in this domain.
The idea of introducing documentation directly within the CMS, like an "onboarding tour guide" or "More info" pop-ups, is something I find innovative and user-centric. I'm also keen on exploring the potential of video content for documentation, as I believe multimedia can significantly enhance user understanding and engagement.

My interest in joining Outreachy with Wagtail stems from a blend of my passion for open-source contributions, my alignment with Wagtail's goals, and the opportunity to make a tangible impact in the realm of CMS accessibility and documentation.

I look forward to connecting with everyone here, from the mentors to fellow contributors, and embarking on this transformative journey together.

## Tasks
### Contributor tasks

We use checklists so all candidates demonstrate their interest and skills with the same process. They will help you get started and make sure youâ€™re on the right track.

#### Checklist: Getting started with Outreachy

This is the first checklist for candidates to go through.

- [x] Read the official [Outreachy Applicant Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/). All of it.

- [x] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.

### Checklist: open source contributions

> For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to go through all the suggested tasks in a single pull request.

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).

### Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHubâ€™s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) youâ€™re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.

The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings â€“Â share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing youâ€™ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
