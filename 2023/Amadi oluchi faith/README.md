# Introduction
Hello everyone,

My name is Amadi Oluchi faith, and I am thrilled to introduce myself as a prospective contributor to the Outreach Internship program. As a Django developer with a passion for accessibility and a strong affinity for asking and answering meaningful questions, I am excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to this community.

A little bit about me:

Technical Background: I have been Learning Programming  for 1 year now, which has equipped me with a deep understanding of web development, Python programming, and the Django framework. I have had the opportunity to work on a range of web projects, from small-scale applications to larger. Through these experiences, I have honed my problem-solving abilities and a strong commitment to creating accessible and inclusive web applications.

Accessibility Advocate: Accessibility is a cause close to my heart. I believe that the web should be an inclusive space where everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access and use digital content without barriers. I have actively incorporated accessibility best practices into my development work and am dedicated to creating digital experiences that cater to a diverse audience. I look forward to furthering this cause within this wagtail Outreach Internship program.

Curiosity and Collaboration: I am naturally inquisitive and have a genuine passion for learning. I love to ask questions and engage in thoughtful discussions, seeking to deepen my understanding of technology and its broader impact. I'm equally eager to share my knowledge and experiences with others, fostering a culture of continuous learning and growth within the community.

As an Outreach Internship contributor, I hope to:

Collaborate with like-minded individuals who share a commitment to promoting accessibility and inclusive design in web development.

Contribute to projects, discussions, and initiatives that align with my expertise in Django, while also learning and expanding my skill set in new areas.

    
Offer my assistance in answering questions and providing guidance to fellow community members, ensuring that meaningful and constructive discussions thrive.

I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to be a part of this community and contribute to its mission. I look forward to connecting with all of you, sharing experiences, and working together to make the web a more accessible and inclusive place for everyone.

Thank you for considering my application, and I am eager to join the Wagtail  Outreach Internship program.

Warm regards,

AmadiÂ OluchiÂ faith

### Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail

   And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide 
   feedback.

   [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside 2023/ with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a README.md file, and 
       copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
