## Introduction

My name is Temidayo Azeez. I am a Backend Developer from Nigeria. I am glad to return as a contributor to the Wagtail project. I first contributed to the Wagtail project in 2022, and it was a great experience that helped me learned a lot within a short time. I must say the same for this year, as I have learned quite a lot about Wagtail and Django than I probably would working on a personal project. 

Open source programmes like Wagtail is the perfect environment for any growing engineer looking to nail a career in software engineering. One, you get to accumulate concrete knowledge for free by getting to work with mentors who are always ready to offer assistance. Second, working on large open source projects helps to understand the task of maintaining large codebases where every action must be carefully designed and executed to ensure code reliabiity and a thriving community. Third, it mirrors a real work environment allowing you to absorb all the necessary skills needed to succeed in a software engineering career. 

Aside Wagtail, I have also contributed to other open source projects such as MindsDB and Jupyterhub. For this year Outreachy programme, I am interested in the `Adopt generic class based views across the Wagtail admin` project. Python/Django is my main stack as a Backend Developer, and this fact got me excited about the project. The journey has been exciting so far. Looking forward to more wins in knowledge, experience and expertise.

  - [x] Your personal website / blog
  - [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [ ] Help others with their pull requests – spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [ ] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### Interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [ ] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you’re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Accessibility features documentation

🚧 This checklist is for candidates interested in working on the [Accessibility features documentation](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/project-ideas.md#accessibility-features-documentation) project.

- [ ] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of **accessibility**. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your understanding _based on past experiences_. For example, any specific accessibility improvements you’ve done in the past, or specific issues you identified. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [ ] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your expertise in **technical writing**. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your expertise _based on past experiences_. For example, any specific documentation writing you’ve done in the past, or other technical writing you’ve made. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [ ] Ask [@thibaudcolas](https://github.com/thibaudcolas) via email or on Slack to give you editor access to a Wagtail website. Once you’ve received access, we ask you to create a new page demonstrating some of Wagtail’s accessibility features.
- [ ] With your access to the demo site and by reviewing our [user guide](https://guide.wagtail.org/), identify a feature of Wagtail which isn’t documented, and report it back on the [guide project issue tracker](https://github.com/wagtail/guide/issues). Make sure to explain what the feature is, why and how you think it should be documented.
- [ ] Draft the new content to document the feature of Wagtail which you’ve reported isn’t documented. Add it to the issue you created as a new comment, so we can provide feedback.
- [ ] Ask [@thibaudcolas](https://github.com/thibaudcolas) via email or on Slack to give you editor access to [guide.wagtail.org](https://guide.wagtail.org/). Once you’ve received access, we ask you to make the necessary changes in the CMS to add the feature documentation.
- [ ] TBC – Additional tasks specific to the Outreachy application process.

### Checklist: Adopt generic class based views across the Wagtail admin

🚧 This checklist is for candidates interested in working on the [Adopt generic class based views across the Wagtail admin](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/project-ideas.md#adopt-generic-class-based-views-across-the-wagtail-admin) project.

- [ ] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of **Django**, in less than 500 words. This can be an intro to an existing project of yours, or perhaps explanation of a specific code snippet you’re particularly proud of, or explanation of a specific problem you worked on. The more specific to your own experience the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

## Research

- [Wagtail GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail) - This has constituted the bulk of my research in understanding the Wagtail machinery.
- [Wagtail Documentation](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/) - The Wagtail official documentation have been very useful in investigating and reproducing unconfirmed bugs. They have also been useful in helping me better understanding Wagtail code base.
- [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/) - The Django documentation has also come very useful in understanding recent development in Django, which provides a good guide in submitting contributions to Wagtail, and also in keeping the Wagtail machinery in tandem with Django latest updates.
- [Project Idea of interest: Adopt generic class based views across all areas of admin](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/8365)
- [Drafttail Docs](https://www.draftail.org/docs/user-guide) - This has also come very handy in understanding Wagtail's Draftail editor(Richtext).
- [Wagtail User Guide](https://guide.wagtail.org/en-latest/) - This has been useful in understanding the expected behaviour of the Wagtail Admin Interface.
