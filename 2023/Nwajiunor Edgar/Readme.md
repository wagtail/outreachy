Hello There,

I'm Nwajiunor, a data scientist from Lagos, Nigeria. I recently transitioned into this exciting field from the field of architecture. I believe my background in architecture when combined with my expertise in data science provides me with a unique set of skills to approach challenges from fresh perspectives.

I am interested in the Accessibility Features Documentation project because I find it interesting that I can use data analysis techniques to prioritize accessibility features and topics that can be addressed in the documentation. I see Outreachy with Wagtail as an opportunity to apply my expertise in a meaningful way while contributing to a project with a strong social impact. Although I have made a first-timer contribution before, this will be my first time contributing extensively over a period of weeks.

A fun spoiler about me: I'm a delightful mix of introvert and extrovert tendencies, leaning towards the introverted side (shh, it's our little secret. Don't tell anyone ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ). For leisure, I like surfing the internet to find out what's happening around the world and around me. I look forward to having an amazing collaborative experience here.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) youâ€™re interested in.

You can describe any recent learnings â€“Â share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing youâ€™ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

## Blog Posts

1. [Discipline as a Habit](https://medium.com/@temiwaji/discipline-as-a-habit-b392d91efa18)

 This is a short blog post on nuturing the habit of discipline, which is something I have been learning for a while now. The word count for the write up was less than 500 and it  scored a Grade of 4 on the Hemingway App.
