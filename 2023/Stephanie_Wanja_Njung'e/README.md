Hello everyone,

I am Wanja Njung'e, a Kenyan based in Nairobi. I'm also a first time Outreachy applicant. Being a self taught developer I have greatly benefited from Open Source products as well as well written technical documentation. I cannot wait to also make it easier for others to navigate a product aided by precise documentation.

When I am not on my screen I always have a hook and yarn in hand. I make all sorts of cute crocheted beanies, cardigans and bikinis for my loved ones. I am lucky because I get free muses to practice on and even when they are ill-fitting we can laugh it off as I learn what not to do next time.

I enjoy reading a lot too though lately I'd been having reader's block and randomly picked up a Chimamanda book and now I'm 3 books in regretting why I'd never indulged her before lol.

Outreachy has presented this exciting challenge, collaborating, connecting with other like minded individuals and the opportunity to be a part of the open source community. Time to dig in!

### Interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [ ] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) youâ€™re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things youâ€™ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings â€“Â share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing youâ€™ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Accessibility features documentation

ðŸš§ This checklist is for candidates interested in working on the [Accessibility features documentation](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/project-ideas.md#accessibility-features-documentation) project.

- [ ] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of accessibility. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your understanding based on past experiences. For example, any specific accessibility improvements youâ€™ve done in the past, or specific issues you identified. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [ ] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your expertise in technical writing. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your expertise based on past experiences. For example, any specific documentation writing youâ€™ve done in the past, or other technical writing youâ€™ve made. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [ ] Ask @thibaudcolas via email or on Slack to give you editor access to a Wagtail website. Once youâ€™ve received access, we ask you to create a new page demonstrating some of Wagtailâ€™s accessibility features.
- [ ] With your access to the demo site and by reviewing our user guide, identify a feature of Wagtail which isnâ€™t documented, and report it back on the guide project issue tracker. Make sure to explain what the feature is, why and how you think it should be documented.
- [ ] Draft the new content to document the feature of Wagtail which youâ€™ve reported isnâ€™t documented. Add it to the issue you created as a new comment, so we can provide feedback.
