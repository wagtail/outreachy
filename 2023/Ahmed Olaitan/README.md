Hi everyone, Iâ€™m Ahmed (pronounced Ah-med). I am UX researcher and designer based in Lagos, Nigeria. I gather experience through freelance and community work. My tech community is called RoadTrip.
Weâ€™re about 400 members and mostly online (Discord, currently transitioning to WhatsApp). What we are is a close-knit community sharing resources on growth career, mental health, job opportunities and the likes. In the community, Iâ€™m a newsletter writer, a social media team member and a buddy group rep (thatâ€™s like a mini community managerðŸ‘€).
When it comes to accessibility in my work, Iâ€™d admit it isnâ€™t something I consciously focus on but Iâ€™ve worked on a few projects where some parts of it were necessary (like content coordination and colour schemes). So, Wagtailâ€™s project is something Iâ€™d like to really learn from.
When I'm not doing anything brain tasking, I'm asleep or consuming fiction like mangas, comics, animes ðŸ˜….
Also, Iâ€™ve contributed in other project rounds (not Wagtail) in the Outreachy cycle and hope that experience will be useful to everyone.
Happy to be here ðŸ˜„.
