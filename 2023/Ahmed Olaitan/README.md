Hi everyone, Iâ€™m Ahmed (pronounced Ah-med). I am UX researcher and designer based in Lagos, Nigeria. I gather experience through freelance and community work. My tech community is called RoadTrip.
Weâ€™re about 400 members and mostly online (Discord, currently transitioning to WhatsApp). What we are is a close-knit community sharing resources on growth career, mental health, job opportunities and the likes. In the community, Iâ€™m a newsletter writer, a social media team member and a buddy group rep (thatâ€™s like a mini community managerðŸ‘€).
When it comes to accessibility in my work, Iâ€™d admit it isnâ€™t something I consciously focus on but Iâ€™ve worked on a few projects where some parts of it were necessary (like content coordination and colour schemes). So, Wagtailâ€™s project is something Iâ€™d like to really learn from.
When I'm not doing anything brain tasking, I'm asleep or consuming fiction like mangas, comics, animes ðŸ˜….
Also, Iâ€™ve contributed in other project rounds (not Wagtail) in the Outreachy cycle and hope that experience will be useful to everyone.
Happy to be here ðŸ˜„.

### Checklist: open source contributions

> For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to go through all the suggested tasks in a single pull request.

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

### Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHubâ€™s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

  - [x] Your GitHub profile

- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [ ] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) youâ€™re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things youâ€™ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings â€“Â share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing youâ€™ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
