## Introduction

Hi everyone. My name is Ryker—a front-end developer and technical based in Nigeria. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc. I wish to contribute to the _Wagtail Accessibility documentation_ due to my love and passion for writing and breaking down complex concepts into a simple and easy-to-follow format. I use Hasnode to blog about what I've learned and also help other people get up to speed with complex web development concepts and projects.

This is my first Open Source contribution. Participating in Outreachy will further widen my scope and understanding of key elements and standard practices needed to succeed in Open Source contribution including what it takes to succeed when working for a tech company. Also, this internship will help me harness my knowledge of Git and GitHub in making Open Source contributions and collaboration. I also wish to learn and help others where necessary.

When I'm not working, I love to take a walk to increase my daily step count 😊😊, I also do anaerobic exercise most times to brush off the stress of a sedentary lifestyle. I hope for a thrilling experience that will positively transform my tech career.

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [ ] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you’re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Accessibility features documentation

Demonstrate your understanding _based on past experiences_. For example, any specific accessibility improvements you’ve done in the past, or specific issues you identified. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [ ] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your expertise in **technical writing**. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your expertise _based on past experiences_. For example, any specific documentation writing you’ve done in the past, or other technical writing you’ve made. The more specific the better.

Make sure to explain what the feature is, why and how you think it should be documented.
- [ ] Draft the new content to document the feature of Wagtail which you’ve reported isn’t documented. Add it to the issue you created as a new comment, so we can provide feedback.
- [ ] Ask [@thibaudcolas](https://github.com/thibaudcolas) via email or on Slack to give you editor access to [guide.wagtail.org](https://guide.wagtail.org/). Once you’ve received access, we ask you to make the necessary changes in the CMS to add the feature documentation.
