# Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, everyone! I'm Spyke Lionel, a Python/Django Developer based in Cameroon. I'm thrilled to be part of the Outreachy program with Wagtail and excited to introduce myself to this amazing community.

As a passionate advocate of open-source development, I've always been drawn to projects like Wagtail that empower creators with user-friendly tools. Joining this project not only aligns with my interests but also provides an opportunity to connect with fellow developers and contribute to the growth of the open-source community.

While this is my first time participating in Outreachy, I have been an avid supporter of open source for years and have contributed to various projects in the past. In addition to my Python coding skills, I have a keen interest in Machine Learning, particularly deep learning, and I'm constantly exploring new ways to merge the worlds of code and intelligent systems.

When I'm not immersed in code, you'll likely find me immersed in a good book or enjoying the rhythms of some soulful music. I believe in the power of continuous learning and personal growth, and I'm excited to embark on this journey with the Outreachy and Wagtail communities. Let's create something amazing together! Once again, it's nice meeting y'all.

### Open Source Contributions

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).

### Your contribution period with Wagtail

- [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHubâ€™s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your GitHub profile
  - [x] Your personal website / blog
  - [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guideâ€™s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [ ] Help others with their pull requests â€“ spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### Interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) youâ€™re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [x] Write a short blog post describing things youâ€™ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings â€“ share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing youâ€™ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Wagtail.org website accessibility

- [x] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of **accessibility**. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your understanding _based on past experiences_. For example, any specific accessibility improvements youâ€™ve done in the past, or specific issues you identified. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [x] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of **Django**, in less than 500 words. This can be an intro to an existing project of yours, or perhaps explanation of a specific code snippet youâ€™re particularly proud of, or explanation of a specific problem you worked on. The more specific to your own experience the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [x] Go through Wagtailâ€™s tutorial: [Your first Wagtail site](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html). If you get stuck, ask for help on Slack or GitHub Discussions.
- [X] Set up [wagtail.org in Gitpod](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail.org), via the "Open in Gitpod" link in the README.
- [ ] Find an accessibility issue on the live [wagtail.org](https://wagtail.org/) website, and report it on the projectâ€™s issue tracker, with appropriate details (title, description, screenshot if applicable, why you think this is an accessibility issue).
- [ ] Fork the [wagtail.org repository](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail.org) and set up your own copy for development, either in Gitpod or on your own computer.
- [ ] Contribute a solution to the issue you selected, by reproducing it on your copy of the project, and submitting a pull request to the main project.
- [ ] TBC â€“ Additional tasks specific to the Outreachy application process.
