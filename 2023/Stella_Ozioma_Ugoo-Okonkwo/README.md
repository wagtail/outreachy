## Introduction

Hello everyone,

My name is Ugoo-Okonkwo Stella Ozioma from Nigeria, I am writing to express my sincere interest in contributing to your open-source project, specifically in the area of Accessibility features documentation. Despite not having prior experience in this domain, I am enthusiastic about learning and will dedicate myself to this task.

I come from a background in web development and possess solid skills in HTML and CSS. I am currently in the process of mastering JavaScript, aiming to broaden my expertise and contribute meaningfully to projects like yours. My familiarity with version control systems like Git and platforms like GitHub ensures that I can collaborate effectively within your team environment.

Although I am yet to venture into the realm of open-source contributions, my passion for web development, coupled with my eagerness to learn, will enable me to make valuable contributions to your documentation efforts. I am motivated by the opportunity to enhance accessibility features, making technology more inclusive for users of all abilities.

What I lack in experience, I make up for in dedication and a strong willingness to learn. I am committed to seeing this project through to completion and am ready to invest the time and effort required to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills.

I am drawn to Wagtail because of its reputation for fostering a collaborative and supportive community. I am eager to immerse myself in this environment, absorb knowledge from experienced contributors, and ultimately contribute to the shared goal of making technology accessible to everyone.

I look forward to learning, growing, and contributing to Wagtail. Please feel free to reach out if you require any additional information or if there are specific tasks I can complete as part of the application process.

Thank You.

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) youâ€™re interested in.

You can describe any recent learnings â€“Â share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing youâ€™ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
