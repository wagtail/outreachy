## Research

My journey to Wagtail mastery has been an adventure in discovery. I've explored the project's codebase, browsed the GitHub repository, and immersed myself in the Slack community. Along the way, I've found a wealth of resources that have helped me to understand Wagtail's inner workings and to build powerful and flexible websites.

Here's a list of my favorite resources, in no particular order:

- **Wagtail's [official documentation](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/index.html)**: This comprehensive guide covers everything from getting started to advanced topics. It's my go-to resource for learning about new features and for resolving any problems I encounter. 

- **Wagtail's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail)**: The Wagtail codebase is a treasure trove of knowledge. I love browsing the code to learn how Wagtail is implemented and to see what other developers are working on.

- **[Google](https://google.com) search engine**: Google has been an essential resource for me in finding information about all aspects of Wagtail development. I can use Google to search for blog posts, tutorials, documentation, and other resources.

- **Wagtail [website](https://wagtail.org/)**: The Wagtail website is a one-stop shop for Wagtail news, documentation, and community resources. It's also a great place to find links to Wagtail tutorials, books, and other learning materials.

- **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)**: ChatGPT has been a valuable resource for me in understanding the Wagtail codebase and for brainstorming new feature ideas. I can ask ChatGPT questions about the code, and it can generate explanations in a clear and concise way.

- **Wagtail [User Guide](https://guide.wagtail.org/en-latest/)**: This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Wagtail's features and functionality. It's a great resource for learning how to use Wagtail to build all sorts of websites, from simple blogs to complex e-commerce sites.
- **Google's [Bard](https://bard.google.com)**: Bard has been helpful for me in answering general questions about Wagtail and for providing creative insights into different ways to use Wagtail. I can also use Bard to generate code snippets and scripts.

- **Wagtail's [Slack channel](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack)**: The Wagtail Slack community is incredibly welcoming and helpful. I've always been able to find answers to my questions, no matter how obscure.

- **Wagtail [contribution guide](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/contributor-guide.md) on how to contribute**: This guide provides everything you need to know about contributing to Wagtail, from writing code to submitting bug reports and pull requests.

- **[YouTube Tutorials or Videos](https://www.youtube.com/@wagtail4333/videos) on how to contribute**: YouTube has been a great way for me to learn about Wagtail visually. There are many informative videos on YouTube that cover a wide range of topics, from getting started with Wagtail to building specific features.

 - [ ] Introduce yourself on our Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions discussion thread.
 - [x] And-or introduce yourself on the Wagtail Slack in #new-contributors.
 - [x] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.


### **Checklist: open source contributions** 
This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

 - [x] Read through How to contribute to open source
 - [ ] 🚧 Read Open source etiquette
 - [x] Make your first pull request with us! Add your name to the list of participants in 2023/README.md.

### **Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail**
And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

 - [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside 2023/ with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a README.md file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
 - [x] Read through GitHub’s Markdown formatting documentation
 - [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
   - [x] Your GitHub profile
   - [x] Your personal website / blog
   - [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
 - [x] Update your pull request to add a new ## Tasks section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [ ] 🚧 Help others with their pull requests – spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### **Checklist: interest in learning**
With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the outreachy repository in the 2023/ folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new ## Research section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you’re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax ([link text](link url)), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [x] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on https://hemingwayapp.com/. You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### **Checklist: Accessibility features documentation**
🚧 This checklist is for candidates interested in working on the Accessibility features documentation project.

- [ ] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of accessibility. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words.

The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [ ] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your expertise in technical writing. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your expertise based on past experiences. For example, any specific documentation writing you’ve done in the past, or other technical writing you’ve made. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [ ] Ask @thibaudcolas via email or on Slack to give you editor access to a Wagtail website. Once you’ve received access, we ask you to create a new page demonstrating some of Wagtail’s accessibility features.
 With your access to the demo site and by reviewing our user guide, identify a feature of Wagtail which isn’t documented, and report it back on the guide project issue tracker. Make sure to explain what the feature is, why and how you think it should be documented.
- [ ] Draft the new content to document the feature of Wagtail which you’ve reported isn’t documented. Add it to the issue you created as a new comment, so we can provide feedback.
- [ ] Ask @thibaudcolas via email or on Slack to give you editor access to guide.wagtail.org. Once you’ve received access, we ask you to make the necessary changes in the CMS to add the feature documentation.
