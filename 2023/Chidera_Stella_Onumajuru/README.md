## Introduction

- Hello Everyone, my name is Chidera, and I am a Backend Developer. I write codes using Python and its frameworks such as Django and FastAPI. I am currently in Nigeria.

- Participating in Outreachy will help me get mentorship from seasoned developers, which will deepen my knowledge. My interest in wagtail stemmed because it was written with my favourite framework-Django, and how one can quickly scaffold a blog using it. Its flexibility for developers is also very appealing to me. Having skimmed over some parts of the documentation, the project (Adopt generic class-based views across all areas of admin) resonates with me. It promises to be challenging and exciting, which is what I greatly crave at this stage of my career.

- When I am not coding, I write technical articles about Postgres. I also spend my day reading paranormal and thriller novels from renowned authors such as Laurie Forest and John Grisham. I look forward to collaborating and learning from you all.

## Tasks

[Checklist:open source contributions](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/contributor-guide.md#checklist-open-source-contributions)

- [x] Read Open source etiquette
- [x] Make your first pull request with us! Add your name to the list of participants in 2023/README.md.

[Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/contributor-guide.md#checklist-your-contribution-period-with-wagtail)

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside 2023/ with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a README.md file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHub’s Markdown formatting documentation
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
- [x] Your GitHub profile
- [x] Your personal website / blog
- [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new ## Tasks section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [ ] Help others with their pull requests – spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

[Checklist: interest in learning](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/contributor-guide.md#checklist-interest-in-learning)
With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the outreachy repository in the 2023/ folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new ## Research section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you’re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax ([link text](link url)), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [x] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on https://hemingwayapp.com/. You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

[Checklist: Adopt generic class-based views across all areas of admin](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/contributor-guide.md#checklist-adopt-generic-class-based-views-across-the-wagtail-admin)

🚧 This checklist is for candidates interested in working on the Adopt generic class based views across the Wagtail admin project.

- [x] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of Django, in less than 500 words. This can be an intro to an existing project of yours, or perhaps explanation of a specific code snippet you’re particularly proud of, or explanation of a specific problem you worked on. The more specific to your own experience the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [x] Go through Wagtail’s tutorial: Your first Wagtail site. With the level of Django expertise needed for this project, we expect you to be able to complete it autonomously in less than 2 hours. If you get stuck, ask for help on Slack or GitHub Discussions.
Go through Wagtail’s guide: Your first contribution.
- [ ] Find a first issue to work on within Wagtail, based on the guidance in section "5. Finding an issue". In particular, report back whether you can reproduce the problem/scenario described in the issue, and any notes / thoughts about how to solve it.
Contribute a solution to the issue you selected based on guidance in section "6. Contributing a solution".
- [ ] TBC – Additional tasks specific to the Outreachy application process.
