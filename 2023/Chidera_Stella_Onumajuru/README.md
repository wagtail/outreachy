## Introduction

- Hello Everyone, my name is Chidera, and I am a Backend Developer. I write codes using Python and its frameworks such as Django and FastAPI. I am currently in Nigeria.

- Participating in Outreachy will help me get mentorship from seasoned developers, which will deepen my knowledge. My interest in wagtail stemmed because it was written with my favourite framework-Django, and how one can quickly scaffold a blog using it. Its flexibility for developers is also very appealing to me. Having skimmed over some parts of the documentation, the project (Adopt generic class-based views across all areas of admin) resonates with me. It promises to be challenging and exciting, which is what I greatly crave at this stage of my career.

- When I am not coding, I write technical articles about Postgres. I also spend my day reading paranormal and thriller novels from renowned authors such as Laurie Forest and John Grisham. I look forward to collaborating and learning from you all.

It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
