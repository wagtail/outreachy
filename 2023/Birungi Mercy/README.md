# Mercy Birungi - Outreachy Application

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Mercy Birungi, and I'm captivated by what Wagtail represents. Wagtail is more than just an open-source content management system (CMS) built on Django; it's a platform that embodies the spirit of accessible and impactful content creation. Its reputation among developers and content editors is well-deserved, thanks to its powerful features and an intuitive interface that fosters a seamless content editing experience.

What sets Wagtail apart and why it resonates with me is its commitment to inclusivity. It's not just about managing content; it's about making sure that the digital world is accessible to all, regardless of their abilities. This aligns perfectly with my passion for technology's transformative power and my desire to bridge the gap between data science and software development.

I am specifically interested in Wagtail project #1 because I would like to improve my technical writing abilities 

## Why Outreachy and Open Source?

I'm here because I believe in the mission of Outreachy and the power of open source collaboration. Outreachy offers a unique opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects, like those involving Wagtail, while also promoting diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.

## About Me

**Data Science & Software Development Professional | Bridging the Gap for Impactful Solutions**

I've always been fascinated by the intersection of data, technology, and human impact. My journey started as a software developer, where I honed my skills in building user-centric and efficient applications. What makes me tick is the potential of machine learning. It's a technology that can unlock profound insights from data and automate tasks in ways previously unimaginable. To harness this power, I embarked on a mission to bridge the gap between data science and software development. My passion lies in crafting innovative solutions that seamlessly combine functionality with data-driven intelligence.

## Fun Fact

I find immense joy in volunteering within my community. It not only brings a smile to my face but also reinforces my belief in the positive impact that technology and community involvement can have.

## Checklist: 

Interest in learning

   

- [x] Create a new **Research** section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you’re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax ([link text](link URL)), so we can understand your choice of resources.

- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or lower on [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/). You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
