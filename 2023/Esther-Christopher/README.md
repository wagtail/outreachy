# Introduction
Hello fellow contributors👋🏻, my names are Esther Christopher, (but you can a call me Nana) and I'm based in Lagos, Nigeria.

I'm a technical writer with particular interests in API documentation. I'm also a front-end developer.

A little sidebar ---
Interestingly enough, I got into the initial application stage of Outreachy last year and guess what project I gravitated towards- ta-da Wagtail!
Unfortunately, Nigerian universities called off the strike just before the final application and all Nigerian students had to stop with the process.

As someone who loves everything documentation from how-to's to tutorials, and everything in between, it was a no-brainer to join the Wagtail project. I'm quite versed in writing documentation having written a couple of them and also familiar with contributing to open-source.

Knowing the importance of accessibility in software development, it piqued my interest that Wagtail was extending it to documentation so I knew I wanted to be part of the "Accessibility features documentation" project.

It's a delight to be here and I absolutely look forward to making acquaintance with other contributors as well as help each other when needed.

## Tasks
### Contributor tasks

We use checklists so all candidates demonstrate their interest and skills with the same process. They will help you get started and make sure you’re on the right track.

#### Checklist: Getting started with Outreachy

This is the first checklist for candidates to go through.

- [x] Read the official [Outreachy Applicant Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/). All of it.
- [x] Read the official [Outreachy Internship Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/).
- [x] If you haven’t already, create a GitHub account.
- [x] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/discussions/1) discussion thread.
- [x] And-or introduce yourself [on the Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack) in [#new-contributors](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack#new-contributors).
- [x] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.

### Checklist: open source contributions

> For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to go through all the suggested tasks in a single pull request.

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).

### Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHub’s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your GitHub profile
  - [x] Your personal website / blog
  - [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [x] Help others with their pull requests – spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).


### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you’re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [x] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).


### Checklist: Accessibility features documentation

🚧 This checklist is for candidates interested in working on the [Accessibility features documentation](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/project-ideas.md#accessibility-features-documentation) project.


- [x] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of **accessibility**. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your understanding _based on past experiences_. For example, any specific accessibility improvements you’ve done in the past, or specific issues you identified. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [x] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your expertise in **technical writing**. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your expertise _based on past experiences_. For example, any specific documentation writing you’ve done in the past, or other technical writing you’ve made. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [x] Ask [@thibaudcolas](https://github.com/thibaudcolas) via email or on Slack to give you editor access to a Wagtail website. Once you’ve received access, we ask you to create a new page demonstrating some of Wagtail’s accessibility features.
- [x] With your access to the demo site and by reviewing our [user guide](https://guide.wagtail.org/), identify a feature of Wagtail which isn’t documented, and report it back on the [guide project issue tracker](https://github.com/wagtail/guide/issues). Make sure to explain what the feature is, why and how you think it should be documented.
- [x] Draft the new content to document the feature of Wagtail which you’ve reported isn’t documented. Add it to the issue you created as a new comment, so we can provide feedback.
- [ ] Ask [@thibaudcolas](https://github.com/thibaudcolas) via email or on Slack to give you editor access to [guide.wagtail.org](https://guide.wagtail.org/). Once you’ve received access, we ask you to make the necessary changes in the CMS to add the feature documentation.
- [ ] TBC – Additional tasks specific to the Outreachy application process.
