Hello everyone.

I'm Taiwo Adeyombo, a Nigerian-based Data Scientist and writer. My fascination with open source stems from its collaborative nature, which aligns with my belief in the power of collective efforts to drive innovation and positive change.

Music fuels most of my days â€“ it's my constant companion. My selection of music depends entirely on my mood, so you can catch me listening to Emeli Sande one minute and Nas the next. When I'm not chasing deadlines or buried in work, you'll find me trying out new recipes, buried in a book or seeing a movie/ TV series.

I decided to contribute to Wagtail because of my genuine interest in all three projects. Before I focused particularly on data science, I took some general Python programming classes, so I'm pretty familiar with the Django framework. Plus, I've got some skills in technical documentation and technical writing. for accessibility. I'm eager to contribute my skills and learn from this vibrant community.

Thank you.
