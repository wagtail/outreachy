# Introduction

Hello everyone!
I am Praise Agbabiaka, a web developer from Nigeria, who advocates for and specializes in accessible web development.
I have first-hand experience of the barriers that a lack of accessibility can present for persons with disabilities. So, when I stumbled on a web development course by Mozilla that introduced me to the basics of digital accessibility, I resolved to grow my skill in digital accessibility so I can build websites and web applications that are as accessible as possible.
I adopt the Shift-Left approach to digital accessibility and so believe that accessibility is best incorporated from the start of a web development project.
My first open-source project was contributing descriptions of the flags of the 194 sovereign countries in the REST Countries API so that web developers who consume the API for their web projects can use the descriptions as alt text of the flag images.
I am excited to be one of those contributing to Wagtail project 3 i.e. Wagtail.org website accessibility.
I look forward to learning and collaborating with you all!

## Tasks

### Getting started with Outreachy

- [x] Read the official [Outreachy Applicant Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/). All of it.
- [x] Read the official [Outreachy Internship Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/).
- [x] If you haven’t already, create a GitHub account.
- [x] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/discussions/1) discussion thread.
- [x] And-or introduce yourself [on the Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack) in [#new-contributors](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack#new-contributors).
- [x] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.

### Open Source Contributions

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).

### Your contribution period with Wagtail

- [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHub’s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your GitHub profile
  - [x] Your personal website / blog
  - [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [x] Help others with their pull requests – spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### Interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you’re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [x] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Wagtail.org website accessibility

- [x] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of **accessibility**. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your understanding _based on past experiences_. For example, any specific accessibility improvements you’ve done in the past, or specific issues you identified. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [x] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of **Django**, in less than 500 words. This can be an intro to an existing project of yours, or perhaps explanation of a specific code snippet you’re particularly proud of, or explanation of a specific problem you worked on. The more specific to your own experience the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [x] Go through Wagtail’s tutorial: [Your first Wagtail site](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html). If you get stuck, ask for help on Slack or GitHub Discussions.
- [x] Set up [wagtail.org in Gitpod](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail.org), via the "Open in Gitpod" link in the README.
- [x] Find an accessibility issue on the live [wagtail.org](https://wagtail.org/) website, and report it on the project’s issue tracker, with appropriate details (title, description, screenshot if applicable, why you think this is an accessibility issue).
- [x] Fork the [wagtail.org repository](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail.org) and set up your own copy for development, either in Gitpod or on your own computer.
- [x] Contribute a solution to the issue you selected, by reproducing it on your copy of the project, and submitting a pull request to the main project.
- [ ] TBC – Additional tasks specific to the Outreachy application process.
