## Introduction

Hello everyone, I'm Nishant Nayan, a first time Outreachy intern from India. Although I had given my brief intro on Slack but I felt like I should tell about me in detail. Hope I'm not too late!

So here I am, with luck favouring my side, I have reached this far being considered for Outreachy internship. I'm very excited for contributing in Open Source actively. Although I have made a couple of contributions before applying for Outreachy, but this is all new to me and I am excited about the part where I will be contributing with my skills and exploring new opportunities.

I am a graduate in mechanical engineering, I did found later on that I am very interested in development so I left my job in manufacturing sector. I found my interest in learning Python and later on I went for learning Django for creating more intense projects. I have learnt the basics of Django but I am yet to create a project using this framework. I have learnt frontend skills like HTML, CSS and Javascript and created couple of projects which you can navigate to with links Portfolio and Weather App.

After having introduced to Wagtail, I found my hidden interest, which is, writing long/short articles which I used to, when I was in college. So I am looking forward to writing more content and blogs about things that I like.

Speaking about my side interests, I like to take long strolls listening to upbeat music and playing video games, COD in particular. These activities help me cool off mind and focus on other things in a better way.

Hope you all made it this far and got to know me a little. Thanks for reading!
Open to your ideas and suggestions on how to improve my writing skills :)
