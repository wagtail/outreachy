Hello everyone.
My name I'm Fatima-Bint Ibrahim. I'm from Ghana. Professionally, I worked as a network engineer. However, my passion for software development got me back to pursue web development. My experience with Django has been particularly rewarding, anchoring my interest in web frameworks. After getting back to web development, my passion for accessibility was ignited by a critical eye I developed after encountering websites with suboptimal designs and poor color contrast. Recognizing these challenges, I committed to advocating for better accessibility standards among my peers in the web development community. I've since dedicated myself to learning and implementing best practices in accessibility to ensure users of my products have a seamless and inclusive online experience.

Beyond development, I've channeled my passion for writing as the co-lead for technical writing and blogging team within the PyLadies Ghana community. There, we break down Python concepts into digestible tutorials, making programming more accessible to learners. With these experiences, I am very much interested in contributing to the accessibility features documentation project.

I mostly use Python especially in the areas of data science and machine learning, and I've always been interested in many parts of tech. Being a beneficiary of many open source initiatives and products, I think it's now time to start giving back. I hope that with Outreachy and Wagtail, I can start my journey into open source contribution.

I am obsessed with productivity tools and systems and I'm deeply committed to the principles of the Second Brain methodology. In my idle times I mostly like to read and listen to audiobooks alongside and yah I like to sleep as well. 😂
I'm also looking forward to making new connections 🥳
