# A stroll into my miniverse 😊🚀
Hello everyone.<br>

My name I'm **Fatima-Bint Ibrahim**. I'm from **Ghana**. Professionally, I worked as a network engineer. However, my passion for software development got me back to pursue web development. My experience with Django has been particularly rewarding, anchoring my interest in **web frameworks**. After getting back to web development, my passion for **accessibility** was ignited by a critical eye I developed after encountering websites with **suboptimal designs and poor color contrast**. Recognizing these challenges, I committed to advocating for better accessibility standards among my peers in the web development community. I've since dedicated myself to learning and implementing best practices in accessibility to ensure users of my products have a seamless and inclusive online experience.

Beyond development, I've channeled my passion for writing as the co-lead for **technical writing and blogging** team within the PyLadies Ghana community. There, we break down Python concepts into digestible tutorials, making programming more accessible to learners. With these experiences, I am very much interested in contributing to the **accessibility features documentation project**.

I mostly use Python especially in the areas of **data science and machine learning**, and I've always been interested in many parts of tech. Being a beneficiary of many open source initiatives and products, I think it's now time to start giving back. I hope that with Outreachy and Wagtail, I can start my journey into open source contribution.

I am obsessed with productivity tools and systems and I'm deeply committed to the principles of the *Second Brain* methodology. In my idle times I mostly like to read and listen to audiobooks alongside and yah I like to sleep as well. 😂
I'm also looking forward to making new connections 🥳

Feel free to connect with on these platforms.

## Tasks
> [!NOTE]
> - [x] Completed task
> - [ ] Pending task
> - [ ] 🚧 Task in progress

### **Checklist: Getting started with Outreachy** 
This is the first checklist for candidates to go through.

 - [x] Read the official Outreachy Applicant Guide. All of it.
 - [x] Read the official Outreachy Internship Guide.
 - [x] If you haven’t already, create a GitHub account.
 - [ ] Introduce yourself on our Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions discussion thread.
 - [x] And-or introduce yourself on the Wagtail Slack in #new-contributors.
 - [x] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.


### **Checklist: open source contributions** 
This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

 - [x] Read through How to contribute to open source
 - [ ] 🚧 Read Open source etiquette
 - [x] Make your first pull request with us! Add your name to the list of participants in 2023/README.md.

### **Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail**
And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

 - [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside 2023/ with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a README.md file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
 - [x] Read through GitHub’s Markdown formatting documentation
 - [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
   - [x] Your GitHub profile
   - [x] Your personal website / blog
   - [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
 - [x] Update your pull request to add a new ## Tasks section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [ ] 🚧 Help others with their pull requests – spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### **Checklist: interest in learning**
With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the outreachy repository in the 2023/ folder, and making pull requests.

- [ ] Create a new ## Research section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you’re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax ([link text](link url)), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or better on https://hemingwayapp.com/. You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### **Checklist: Accessibility features documentation**
🚧 This checklist is for candidates interested in working on the Accessibility features documentation project.

- [ ] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your understanding of accessibility. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your understanding based on past experiences. For example, any specific accessibility improvements you’ve done in the past, or specific issues you identified. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [ ] Write a short blog post which demonstrates your expertise in technical writing. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your expertise based on past experiences. For example, any specific documentation writing you’ve done in the past, or other technical writing you’ve made. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [ ] Ask @thibaudcolas via email or on Slack to give you editor access to a Wagtail website. Once you’ve received access, we ask you to create a new page demonstrating some of Wagtail’s accessibility features.
 With your access to the demo site and by reviewing our user guide, identify a feature of Wagtail which isn’t documented, and report it back on the guide project issue tracker. Make sure to explain what the feature is, why and how you think it should be documented.
- [ ] Draft the new content to document the feature of Wagtail which you’ve reported isn’t documented. Add it to the issue you created as a new comment, so we can provide feedback.
- [ ] Ask @thibaudcolas via email or on Slack to give you editor access to guide.wagtail.org. Once you’ve received access, we ask you to make the necessary changes in the CMS to add the feature documentation.
- [ ] TBC – Additional tasks specific to the Outreachy application process.



## Research
Here are research resources I have found useful to understanding open source contribution, contributing to Wagtail and accessibility.

### Wagtail
- [Wagtail Interfaces](https://guide.wagtail.org/en-latest/concepts/wagtail-interfaces/)
  - **Summary**:This is a page within the wagtail's user guide which specifies the different interfaces within the Wagtail CMS. It provides an overview of the key interfaces you'll encounter, such as the admin interface for content management and the developer interface for customization.
 -[Official Documentation](docs.wagtail.io)
  - **Summary**: This is omprehensive guide to Wagtail's features, best for understanding the CMS from a developer's perspective.
-[Wagtail User Guide](guide.wagtail.org)
 - **Summary**: The Wagtail User Guide is more user-centric and seems to be aimed at end-users who are managing content within Wagtail.
 - 
> [!INFO]
> Initially, I was confused about what the difference between the Official Documentation and the User Guide but I finally got a simplified understanding.
> The official documentation is more developer-centric providing in-depth technical details, the Wagtail User Guide is aimed at end-users with a focus on managing content and understanding Wagtail's user interfaces and best practices.
> I hope this will help anyone who's also confused as I was.
