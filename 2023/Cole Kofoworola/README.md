## Introduction

Hi everyone! My name is **Kofoworola Cole** from Lagos, Nigeria. I am excited to be here contributing to this project. I have worked with Wordpress CMS before so I am very interested in participating in Outreachy. Wagtail CMS stood out for me and I will be contributing to the _Accessibility features documentation_.

I started learning front-end development during my career break during childbirth about a year ago. I currently major in _HTML, CSS, Javascript, and technical writing._ I am particularly interested in the Django framework and I hope to add this to my stack as I advance to becoming a full-stack developer.

I love classical music, I play the clarinet for fun and I love nature.

This is my first time participating in Outreachy. I read about Open Source sometime this year and made 2 contributions to a friend's project and it felt like I made a significant impact. It was amazing. I am happy to work with everyone.
