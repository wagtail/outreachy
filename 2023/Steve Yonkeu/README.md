## Introduction

Hello everyone, I am Steve Yonkeu, your friendly neighborhood software engineer with a knack for all things data science and machine learning. Now, don’t let the 'engineer' title fool you; I’m not just about codes and algorithms. Oh no, I’ve got a wild side that enjoys promoting African culture, which I showcased at the mEducation Alliance. It’s all about striking the perfect balance between binary and bantu, codes and culture!

I have a soft spot for community events, and was thrilled to join the tech crusaders at the Deep Learning Indaba 2023 event in Ghana. Let’s just say, the event was a mix of deep learning with a sprinkle of deep laughter!

Helping others is my jam and I am often seen lending a helping hand, or code, to those in need. While I might appear quiet at first glance, don’t underestimate the whirlwind of ideas brewing beneath the calm exterior. So, whether it's cracking a code or a joke, count me in!
