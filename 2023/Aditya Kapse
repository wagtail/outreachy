## Tasks
**Contributor tasks**

We use checklists so all candidates demonstrate their interest and skills with the same process. They will help you get started and make sure you’re on the right track.

**Checklist: Getting started with Outreachy**

This is the first checklist for candidates to go through.

- [x] Read the official Outreachy Applicant Guide. All of it.
- [x] Read the official Outreachy Internship Guide.
- [x] If you haven’t already, create a GitHub account.
- [x] Introduce yourself on our Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions discussion thread.
- [x] And-or introduce yourself on the Wagtail Slack in #new-contributors.
- [x] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.

Checklist: open source contributions

> For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to go through all the suggested tasks in a single pull request.

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through How to contribute to open source
- [x] Read Open source etiquette
- [x] Make your first pull request with us! Add your name to the list of participants in 2023/README.md.

Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside 2023/ with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a README.md file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHub’s Markdown formatting documentation
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
    - [x] Your GitHub profile
    - [x] Your personal website / blog
    - [x] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new ## Tasks section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [] Help others with their pull requests – spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).
