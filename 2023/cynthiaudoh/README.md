# Introduction
Hello everyone, my name is Cynthia, an Outreachy Applicant. 
I'm based in Nigeria. My next birthday is May 3rd 2024. 
I love to eat and read novels. 
I'm also passionate about community management.

I'm really excited to dive into Wagtail's Accessibility features documentation project as my first step into the open-source world and even in Outreachy. 
I've always had a knack for taking complex concepts i learn about and breaking them down into their simplest form (yeah you caught me. I love technical writing) :). 
It's something I genuinely enjoy doing. 
Now, as I'm starting to learn about accessibility through Wagtail, I've realized just how impactful it can be when it comes to navigating digital platforms. 
What's even more interesting is that I never really paid attention to these things before, but now they're standing out to me.

I'm excited to collaborate with others who share my passion for making technology more inclusive, and I believe this project is a great starting point to make a real impact.
