Hi everyone,
I am Oghenekevbe. Most persons can't pronounce it so they call kewe (lol), which is just fine as it means the same thing which is "God's Gift".
I am from the southern part of Nigeria.
I work with HTML , CSS, Javascript (which I am still learning), python and Django.
I was drawn to the 'Adopt generic class based views across the Wagtail admin' project while scrolling through.
I am new to open source and I have always looked forward to it, so I am excited to be here.

Realizing I didn't need to have a computer science degree to learn tech really changed my perspective so I dove in headfirst.
Outreachy inspired me from the point of writing the application. Everything is so detailed and encourages you to want to push yourself.
I am barely a year in tech but I have learned a lot and now, Open Source Contribution.
I am very motivated.

When I am not in front of my laptop ruining my eyes, I am reading a novel, taking pictures (documentary photography. I've got quite the collection of candid shots) or chasing my white haired pink nosed bunny around the house.

I look forward to being part of a community and learning from everyone
