## 📖 About Nouman Wali <a name="about-nouman"></a>

I am Nouman Wali. I have been connected with the software industry for the last 5 years. The key skills are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, UI testing, and content writing. I have experience handling web and mobile-based application projects as a project manager in a small software house. While working in the software industry, I realized that writing documentation and interactive content is something that I want to pursue in my life.

I decided to dig more into technical writing. I have been contributing to open-source projects for the last 6 to 7 months. The open-source contribution is really fun and provides professional and interpersonal skills.

This is my first time participating in the Outreachy contribution program. The reason for joining the program is to learn new technologies, collaborate with new people, and get an understanding of the professional environment.

I love to go hiking in the beautiful mountains of Islamabad, Pakistan. The daily jogging and gym workouts are two of the most important tasks that I do. On weekends, I love to spend some time with my family doing outdoor activities.
Thank you.

## 🚀 Tasks <a name="tasks"></a>

#### ✅ Checklist: Getting started with Outreachy <a name="getting-started-checklist"></a>

This is the first checklist for candidates to go through.

- [ ] Read the official [Outreachy Applicant Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/). All of it.
- [ ] Read the official [Outreachy Internship Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/).
- [ ] If you haven’t already, create a GitHub account.
- [ ] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/discussions/1) discussion thread.
- [ ] And-or introduce yourself [on the Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack) in [#new-contributors](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack#new-contributors).
- [ ] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and is generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### ✅ Checklist: open source contributions <a name="checklist-open-source-contributions"></a>

> For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to go through all the suggested tasks in a single pull request.

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [ ] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [ ] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [ ] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### ✅ Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail <a name="contribution-period-checklist"></a>

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, and your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [ ] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [ ] Read through GitHub’s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [ ] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [ ] Your GitHub profile
  - [ ] Your personal website/blog
  - [ ] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [ ] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [ ] Help others with their pull requests – spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [ ] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### ✅ Checklist: interest in learning <a name="learning-interest-checklist"></a>

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [ ] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you’re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### ✅ Checklist: Accessibility features documentation <a name="accessibility-features-documentation-checklist"></a>

🚧 This checklist is for candidates interested in working on the [Accessibility features documentation](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/blob/main/project-ideas.md#accessibility-features-documentation) project.

- [ ] Write a short blog post that demonstrates your understanding of **accessibility**. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your understanding _based on past experiences_. For example, any specific accessibility improvements you’ve done in the past, or specific issues you identified. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [ ] Write a short blog post that demonstrates your expertise in **technical writing**. In English, with at least one image, less than 500 words. Demonstrate your expertise _based on past experiences_. For example, any specific documentation writing you’ve done in the past, or other technical writing you’ve made. The more specific the better. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
- [ ] Ask [@thibaudcolas](https://github.com/thibaudcolas) via email or on Slack to give you editor access to a Wagtail website. Once you’ve received access, we ask you to create a new page demonstrating some of Wagtail’s accessibility features.
- [ ] With your access to the demo site and by reviewing our [user guide](https://guide.wagtail.org/), identify a feature of Wagtail that isn’t documented, and report it back on the [guide project issue tracker](https://github.com/wagtail/guide/issues). Make sure to explain what the feature is, why, and how you think it should be documented.
- [ ] Draft the new content to document the feature of Wagtail which you’ve reported isn’t documented. Add it to the issue you created as a new comment, so we can provide feedback.
- [ ] Ask [@thibaudcolas](https://github.com/thibaudcolas) via email or on Slack to give you editor access to [guide.wagtail.org](https://guide.wagtail.org/). Once you’ve received access, we ask you to make the necessary changes in the CMS to add the feature documentation.
- [ ] TBC – Additional tasks specific to the Outreachy application process.
