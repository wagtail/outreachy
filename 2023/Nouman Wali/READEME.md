Hello Everyone,
I am Nouman Wali. I have been connected with the software industry for the last 5 years. The key skills are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, UI Testing, and content writing. I have experience in handling web and mobile-based application projects as a project manager in a small software house. While working in the software industry, I realized that writing documentation and interactive content is something that I want to pursue in my life.

I decided to dig more into technical writing. I have been contributing to open-source projects for the last 6 to 7 months. The open-source contribution is really fun and provides professional and interpersonal skills.

This is my first time participating in the Outreachy contribution program. The reason for joining the program is to learn new technologies, collaborate with new people, and get an understanding of the professional environment.

I love to go hiking in the beautiful mountains of Islamabad, Pakistan. The daily jogging and gym workout is one of the important tasks that I do. On weekends, I love to spend some time with my family for outdoor activities.
Thank you

## Tasks

#### Checklist: Getting started with Outreachy

This is the first checklist for candidates to go through.

- [ ] Read the official [Outreachy Applicant Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/). All of it.
- [ ] Read the official [Outreachy Internship Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/).
- [ ] If you haven’t already, create a GitHub account.
- [ ] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/discussions/1) discussion thread.
- [ ] And-or introduce yourself [on the Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack) in [#new-contributors](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack#new-contributors).
- [ ] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.

### Checklist: open source contributions

> For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to go through all the suggested tasks in a single pull request.

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [ ] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [ ] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [ ] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).

### Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [ ] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [ ] Read through GitHub’s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [ ] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [ ] Your GitHub profile
  - [ ] Your personal website / blog
  - [ ] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [ ] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [ ] Help others with their pull requests – spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [ ] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the `outreachy` repository in the `2023/` folder, and making pull requests.

- [ ] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) you’re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.

The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings – share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing you’ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesn’t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
