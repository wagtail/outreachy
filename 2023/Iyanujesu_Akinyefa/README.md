### Introduction
I'm Iyanujesu Akinyefa from Nigeria, stepping into the Outreach Internship with a dedication to promoting inclusivity through technology. 

My journey has been marked by diverse data projects, each enhancing my skills in statistical analysis, Python, and data interpretation.

I advocate for accessibility, believing in the power of data to be universally understandable and actionable. 

My curiosity constantly fuels my learning, pushing me to both deepen my own knowledge and actively contribute to our collective understanding.

In this program, I aim to unite with those passionate about making technology accessible, contribute my data analytics expertise, and engage in meaningful exchanges that foster learning and growth.

I'm excited about this journey and eager to collaborate with you all to make a positive impact through data.

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

## Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [x] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside 2023/ with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a README.md file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHubâ€™s Markdown formatting documentation
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:

- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description, even if very concise).

## Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within your fork of the outreachy repository in the 2023/ folder, and making pull requests.

- [ ] Create a new ## Research section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project idea(s) youâ€™re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax ([link text](link url)), so we can understand your choice of resources.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things youâ€™ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or lower on https://hemingwayapp.com/. You can describe any recent learnings â€“ share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing youâ€™ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

The more specific the better.
