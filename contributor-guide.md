# Outreachy contributor guide

ðŸ‘‹ This guide is our main resource for contributors interested in working on Wagtail as part of Outreachy internships. Please read through it all, top to bottom.

## Communication channels

Where possible, we prefer you use Wagtailâ€™s community channels rather than reaching out to mentors or coordinators directly. We use:

- The [Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack), in particular [#outreachy](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack#outreachy)
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/discussions)

## About Wagtail

<!-- Note for maintainers: matches the "Description" field on https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/wagtail/edit/. -->

We build Wagtail, a popular content management system. It's built on Python, by an active and engaged open source community, which has grown rapidly since Wagtail's release in 2014. Wagtail is available in over 40 languages, and used by some of the world's best-known organizations, including NASA, Google, Mozilla, MIT, and the UK's National Health Service, as well as museums, universities, non-profits, governments, banks, studios, restaurants, startups and bloggers around the world.

## Eligibility criteria

We use the same [eligibility criteria](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#eligibility) as every other participating organization. In particular,

- Contributors / applicants must have been pre-approved by Outreachy in order to be eligible to take part in the contribution period during our project.
- You can only be accepted as an Outreachy intern once.
- You must not have a full-time job or contracting position during the Outreachy internship.
- University students must have 42 consecutive days free from school and exams during the internship period.

## Contributor expectations

We expect participants to go through a set of initial tasks as they start to get involved with Wagtailâ€™s community, ahead of their application. This is for you to get to know Wagtail as a project and community, and get a sense of how we can work together. It also helps mentors assess the skills of candidates, so we can decide which projects we can take on with you.

No matter which specific project idea youâ€™re interested in, we expect all participants to demonstrate:

- **A good understanding of Outreachy**.
- Awareness of **how open source contributors collaborate**: clear and effective communication, use of english, online etiquette, code of conduct.
- An **interest in learning and collaboration**: improving in response to feedback, asking questions when appropriate, and helping other contributors.
- Awareness of **how the Wagtail project works**: communication channels, contribution guidelines.
- Knowledge of **git and GitHub**: coders or not, those are fundamental tools for how we work as a community.

### Improve your chances of being accepted

The best thing you can do to improve your chances of being accepted as an Outreachy intern with Wagtail is to start being involved now. Make yourself known to the community. Go through our recommended tasks below, recommended learning resources, and help fellow contributors who are going through the same process. Try to contribute to an area related to the project you will be applying for. When the time comes to evaluate applications, you will be a known individual.

We're here to help, but we can't watch you every step of the way. We need to see motivation from you. Your activities before the application process are the best way to demonstrate this. Any application submitted late, from people we havenâ€™t heard from before, will still be considered but might be met with skepticism.

### Contributor tasks

We use checklists so all candidates demonstrate their interest and skills with the same process. They will help you get started and make sure youâ€™re on the right track.

#### Checklist: Getting started with Outreachy

This is the first checklist for candidates to go through.

- [ ] Read the official [Outreachy Applicant Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/). All of it.
- [ ] Read the official [Outreachy Internship Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/).
- [ ] If you havenâ€™t already, create a GitHub account.
- [ ] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy/discussions/1) discussion thread.
- [ ] And-or introduce yourself [on the Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack) in [#new-contributors](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack#new-contributors).
- [ ] Set up your own personal blog. Blogging is a fundamental part of Outreachy, and generally a good way to solidify learnings. You can use a personal website if you want to, or keep it simple and use a platform like Dev.to, Hashnode, or Medium.

### Checklist: open source contributions

> For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to go through all the suggested tasks in a single pull request.

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [ ] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [ ] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [ ] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).

### Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail

And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

- [ ] Make a fork this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [ ] Read through GitHubâ€™s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [ ] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [ ] Your GitHub profile
  - [ ] Your personal website / blog
  - [ ] Your preferred social profiles if any
- [ ] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your README file, and copy-paste our contributor guideâ€™s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [ ] Help others with their pull requests â€“ spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.

### Checklist: interest in learning

- [ ] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific project tasks youâ€™re interested in. Make sure to use full Markdown link syntax (`[link text](link url)`), so we can understand your choice of resources.

The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 7 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. You can describe any recent learnings â€“Â share a list of the last few articles you read and liked, or focus on one specific thing youâ€™ve been learning. It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (for example Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website, anywhere public), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
